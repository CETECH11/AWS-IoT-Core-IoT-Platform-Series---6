The AWS IoT is a cloud platform ‚òÅ that provides services and solutions to connect and manage billions of devices. Since it is a part of Amazon Web Services, we can pipeline it with other products and services which will open more possibilities. Collect, Store, and Analyze IoT data for industrial, consumer, commercial, and automotive devices üö°. To manage and support these IoT devices in the real-world, AWS IoT Core supports below protocols -

MQTT (Message Queuing and Telemetry Transport)
MQTT over WSS (WebSockets Secure)
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol - Secure)
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)
AWS IoT is an application that can be accessed through different methods - Device SDKs, Command Line Interface (CLI), Application Programming Interface (API), or Console (Dashboard). In our case, we shall be using the AWS Console for a visual representation which is a better way to use an IoT Cloud Platform for connecting with the device.

MQTT is a standards-based messaging protocol, or set of rules, used for machine-to-machine communication. Smart sensors, wearables, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices typically have to transmit and receive data over a resource-constrained network with limited bandwidth.

It is a publish/subscribe protocol for machine-to-machine communication. This simple protocol, is easy to implement for any client. Termed as the Pub and Sub, both are used for same purpose but different method.

Above we can see there are 2 sections (left & right) - Publish and Subscribe. And then there is a middleman - Broker.

IoT Devices play the role to collect sensor data and send to the cloud (broker). While PC/Server/Mobile devices play the role to monitor and receive the sensor data to be viewed - Here, IoT Device is a Publisher, and PC Devices are a Subscriber.We have a more secure layer üîí to make sure the data is shared through a specific path, we call that 'topic', When user1 publishes data on topic, the subscriber automatically receives if already connected to the broker. Hence, the LOW latency.
